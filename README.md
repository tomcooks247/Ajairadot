--Overview--

This is the codebase for the legendary game AgonC inspired by
many games such as GTA, Aguntok, RDR2, etc.
The codebase is currently being re-written in C entirely from the groundup
using OpenGL ES 3.0 for maximum compatibility across systems.

--Libraries used--

*  OpenGL
*  GLFW
*  Assimp
*  Stb_Image_Implementation
*  Cglm
*  Stdio
*  Stdlib
*  Stdbool

--Contribution Policy--

Contribution should be done by first taking a look at our codebase
and then adopting our naming structure, commenting styles and general
approach to programming itself.

--To Do--

! Make functions to do mundane tasks like creating VAOs, VBOs, etc.
! Make a default shader to render basic meshes without lighting.
