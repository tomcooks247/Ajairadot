--Overview--

This is the codebase for the legendary game AgonC inspired by
many games such as GTA, Aguntok, RDR2, etc.
The codebase is currently being re-written in C entirely from the groundup
using OpenGL ES 3.0 for maximum compatibility across systems.

--Libraries used--

*  OpenGL
*  GLFW
*  Assimp
*  Stb_Image_Implementation
*  Cglm
*  Stdio
*  Stdlib
*  Stdbool

--Contribution Policy--

Contribution should be done by first taking a look at our codebase
and then adopting our naming structure, commenting styles and general
approach to programming itself. We have defined some places to put
certain parts of code which must be followed while contributing.

--To Do--

*  Make functions to do mundane tasks like creating VAOs, VBOs, etc.
*  Make structs to handle meshes.
*  Include Assimp support for FBX and GLB/GLTF formats.
