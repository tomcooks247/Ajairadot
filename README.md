# Overview
---

This is the codebase for the legendary game Ajairadot inspired by
many games such as GTA, RDR2, etc.
The codebase is currently being re-written in GDScript entirely from the groundup
using OpenGL ES 3.0 for maximum compatibility across systems.

# Building

As of now building is possible only through source code, cross-platform support
will be included in the future with the help of built-in tools. As of now, to build the
project one should use the build button, this will produce an executable called whatever the project is called.
